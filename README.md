What is Virtual Zone 4:
-----------------------

VZ4 is simply a patch file for DOOM by ID software. You therefore will require 
the following a copy of DOOM in order to use this program. There are a couple 
of different versions of DOOM available, mainly the shareware and the 
registered version. The shareware version is a demo version and only has one 
of the three episodes playable. The shareware version may also be freely 
distributed. The other is the commercial version, which is the full game and 
is obtained by registering the shareware version. Details on how to do this are 
included in the shareware version. To play VZ4 you will need the commercial 
version of DOOM as the shareware version will not work. It is also suggested 
that you have version 1.2 or 1.666 as these are the versions that it was 
tested on, however versions 0.99 and 1.1 should still work. 

VZ4 is actually 3 games in one.
-------------------------------

The first is DOOM with some of the sprites changed.
The next is VZ4 which is the Zone 4 maze in the DOOM engine.
Lastly there is the multiplayer version which is what the game was truly 
designed for.

A NOTE ON TECHNICAL ACCURACY
----------------------------

VZ4 is based on the very first maze. Unfortunately there is no reference to 
it except for what is remembered and the map on the wall. We have however 
tried to keep as close as possible to it. Hope it doesn't ruin the game.

IMPORTANT NOTE!!
----------------

Please note that Virtual Zone 4 version 1.2 does not include the multiplayer
graphics patch. This option is only for registered users, for information on
how to register please see the end of this file.

WHY NOT DOOM 2
--------------

I have written VZ4 to run on DOOM and not DOOM2 for the following reasons.

1 - More people own Doom than Doom2 
2 - There is no significant advantage in using Doom2
3 - More is known about the structure of Doom

THINGS THAT CAME BETWEEN VZ4 AND ITS COMPLETION
-----------------------------------------------

NOTE
----

to complete and we are not asking much for it. Please do not distribute. 
If you purchase it from us you will receive free updates, new maps etc.
